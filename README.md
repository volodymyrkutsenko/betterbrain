BetterBrain itself is a logical addition to a book called "Train Your Brain - 60 Days to a Better Brain" by Ryuta Kawashima.
In case you want to find out what the book is about search it in the Internet (some information available via this link [Train Your Brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_Your_Brain:_60_Days_to_a_Better_Brain)) but here is a brief description of what it offers:
In order to train your brain Ryuta Kawashima suggests simple set of exercises for each day that take no more than 5 minutes.
Every day the trainee should solve a set of 100 simple arithmetical equations as quick as possible. 
Each five days the trainee takes a memory test, a counting test and a stroop test to verify the progress.

The book has this program covered for 60 days. However Ryuta Kawashima insists on continuing the training even after completion of the 60 day program but the book itself does not have any more exercises like ones the trainee has already passed.

The current BetterBrain project is intended to generate the whole 30 day training program similar to what the original book contains.
Each new generated program is completely random and brand new.

Using BetterBrain Arithmetical Equations Generator Release 1.0 release you can generate: <br />
* 30 sheets with 100 simple arithmetical equations for one day in either simple text or DOCX format
* 6 wordsets for memorization tests
Stroop test generation is will be included the next releases.

For time economy you may simply run _betterbrain.bat/sh_ file that will run BetterBrain with its default options and generate the results into files containing equations and memorization wordsets.
